# Web-Scraping
The article was written by the Professor Subash Gandyer about Neural networking. My task is to web scrap the article using python using multiple libraries like Beautiful Soup, os, requests, sys, re. 
Created a function to extract html source from the article source. Then removed all the html tags and clean the file to collect all the text. 
The clean scrapped text file was saved in the local directory.
